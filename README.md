# Rails in Docker with Webpacker

This is an installation of Rails 5.2 running in a Ruby 2.4.9 Docker container.
Webpacker has been added so I can experiment with javascript handling using webpack rather than asset pipeline.

There are a few branches:

1. Master - A Rails 5.2 install with webpacker and cucumber-bdd. This is a good starting point for spinning up functional rails apps with BDD
2. plain-ror - A simple rails 5.2 install
3. webpacker - This has webpacker installed from the Gemfile so that I can see the changes in how javascript is handled
4. cucumber-bdd - The rails 5.2 install with the addition of rspec, cucumber, factory-bot and database-cleaner for BDD testing. The setup follows the following [instruction from Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-a-bdd-stack-on-a-rails-5-application).

## Initial Setup:

- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`
- In a separate terminal `docker-compose run web rake db:create`

## Working with Docker

### Gems

The bundle install action has been extracted away from the Dockerfile as this greatly enhances efficiency of the build process. The gemfile is now checked at `docker-compose up` stage. Therefore whenever you make a change to the gems you should take the containers down with `docker-compose down` and bring them back up with `docker-compose up`.

### Running Tests

- Run all tests with: `docker-compose run web bundle exec rake`
